## Overview

_**Mineralopedia** is a fully searchable database of common minerals and their properties that will act as a guide to proper identification and as a reference. Users will be able to register an account that will allow them to add minerals to favorites and add, edit, and delete comments._

<br>

## MVP

_The **Mineralopedia** MVPs described below will outline the project in clear and discernable steps, in order to ensure the final deliverable is achievable within the time frame given, and that it meets all requirements set forth for the project._

<br>

### Server (Back End) <!-- omit in toc -->

- Have a RESTful JSON API:
  - Build a Ruby on Rails server containing RESTful JSON endpoints.
  - Build a database with at least 3 tables.
    - There must be at least 1 association between your tables.
  - Utilize Rails to define models for interacting with the database.
  - Implement working generic controller actions for Full CRUD between your non-User tables:
  - `index`
  - `show`
  - `create`
  - `update`
  - `delete`

### Client (Front End) <!-- omit in toc -->

- Have a working, interactive React app, built using `npx create-react-app`.
  - Have at least 8 separate, rendered components in an organized and understandable React file structure.
  - Utilize functional and class React components appropriately.
  - Utilize state and props in your components efficiently.
  - Use only React for DOM Manipulation.
- Consume data from your Ruby on Rails API, and render that data in your components.
- Utilize React Router, for client-side routing.
- Demonstrate Full CRUD actions on the front end.

### Styling <!-- omit in toc -->

- Be styled with CSS or SCSS.
- Use Flexbox or Grid in your layout design.
- Implement 2 media queries for responsive design on 3 screen sizes, including desktop.

### Linting <!-- omit in toc -->

- Indent properly.
- Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
- Follow `camelCase`, `snake_case`, and `kebab-case` conventions.
- Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
- Remove all unnecessary code, including commented out code.

### Deployment <!-- omit in toc -->

- Deploy a fully functional front-end via Surge or Netlify.
- Deploy the back-end via Heroku.
- Deploy early and often.

### Procedural <!-- omit in toc -->

- Initialize a git repo on Github, with a links to the deployed project.
- Have **frequent commits**, making a _robust_ commit history at least every day. (75 commits minimum)
- Use effective and safe **branching and merging** processes.

### Goals

- _Build a utilitarian web application_
- _Intuitive design_
- _Looks professionally styled_
- _Seamlessly integrate mobile, tablet, and desktop designs_

### Libraries and Dependencies

> Use this section to list all supporting libraries and dependencies, and their role in the project. Below is an example - this needs to be replaced!

|     Library      | Description                                                                                                                |
| :--------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      React       | _An open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components._                             |
|   React Router   | _Used to define multiple routes in the application._                                                                       |
| React Router DOM | _A popular and well-supported library and is the most preferred routing library for React applications._                   |
|      Axios       | _A great library for making client side HTTP calls._                                                                       |
|      Rails       | _A model-view-controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages._      |
|      Bcrypt      | _A password-hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res._                                                 |
|       Cors       | _Allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the first domain which was served._ |

### Client (Front End)

#### Wireframes

> Use the Wireframes section to display desktop, tablet and mobile views. No hand-drawn wireframes. Use a tool like wireframe.cc, Whimsical or AdobeXD

- Desktop Landing

- Desktop Hero

- Resource Index

- Resource Show

- Tablet Resource Index

- Mobile Resource Index

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components.

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like.

```structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
|__ components/
      |__ Nav.jsx
      |__ Layout.jsx
|__ screens/
      |__ Home.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to include a link to your component tree.

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._
